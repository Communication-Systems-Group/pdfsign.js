## Overview

The "hello world" example is a minimalistic application of the PDF.js project.
The file `helloworld.pdf` originates from the GNUpdf project and contains a
simple and human-readable PDF.

## Getting started

Instead of simply opening `index.html` in a browser, you must serve the page
using a web server. This can be done on your local machine without an internet
connection. In the root directory of PDF.js, run `node make server` in a
terminal. The example can then be viewed using the following URL:

`http://localhost:8888/examples/helloworld/index.html`

Take a look at `hello.js` to see how to make basic calls to PDF.js.
